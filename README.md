# SearchAgent
An AI search-based agent has been developed using Java. The AI agents is presented with a problem where Neo is supposed to save hostages from the matrix. The matrix is represented as an N by N grid. Each cell in the grid initially contains either Neo himself, a single agent, a single hostage, a pill to increase the health of Neo and the hostages, a pad to allow Neo to teleport across the grid or nothing. The search agent is supposed to output a plan (if such a plan is possible) that maximizes the number of hostages saved. In case there is a tie, the search agent outputs the plan with the least number of agents killed. Different search algorithms are used by the AI search agent. These search algorithms include DFS, BFS, uniform cost, greedy (with 2 heuristics) and A* (with 2 heuristics).
